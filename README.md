# Group Project: Chip v. Chap (Marco v. Craig)

This is Team 26's group project for SWEN225 2022.

## Installation 

Clone the repo to your machine.

```bash
git clone ......
```

## Usage

To run our program, run the main class from *nz.ac.vuw.ecs.swen225.gp22.app.Main* (Requires JAVA 17).

## Controls and Gameplay
In this game, you control a character (Marco) and guide him through levels. You will come across gold treasures which all need to be picked up in order to proceed in-game. Coloured keys are present in the levels, which need to be picked up in order to unlock the corresponding doors. Watch out for Craig! If he walks onto a tile occupied by your character, the level will reset. Reach the exits to win the game.

Arrow keys: control your character (re-bindable in GUI)

Control + S: save the game

## Replay Functions
To save a replay you must complete a game, once completed there will be a button to save replay.
To load a replay from the main menu either select "Replay" button for automatic replay or Play by Play
for a Play by play Replay. For a play by play replay the right arrow key will advance the game 1/20th of a second so holding down the button will play through the game at a good speed, but to go slowley simply tap the right arrow key button.
(the play by play may look as though its not moving as its only advancing 1/20 of a second but just keep tapping and you will be away !). In a automatic Replay you will have a check box at the top to increase replay speed to 2x and toggle it off to go back to normal speed.

Games can only be saved when you have completed a game.

## render
tiles include:
wall tile: a purple slab unable to be crossed.

lock tile: diifrfent coulor tiles which ave keys holes waiting for the macthing key inorder to be entered.

coins: collect theses in oder to complete levels, be sure you havent forgotten any.

info tile: a point of information for when your lost, stuck or confused. 

rainbow lock: can only be unlcoked once all teh coins are collected. 

escape tile: the way out or onto the next level, found behind the ranibow lock. 

## Persistency Functions
The persistency module of this application lets users save the current state of the game, and load back where they left off. 

To use the saving feature, use CTRL + S and the game will exit. Next time you play, click the 'Load Game' button on the menu and it'll pick up right where you left off. It saves the states of tiles & doors, stores Chap's inventory, the number of treasures remaining, and the time remaining in the level.
